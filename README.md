After it was decided who will go first, that player will have to answer a trivia question. Successfully answering that question will let that player pick his move first. On the other hand, if that player answered incorrectly, the process of playing rock, paper, scissors will repeat. Each moves have different effects on both the player itself and the opponent. Note that the character's passive is also in effect during the gameplay.</p>
